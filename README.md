# GRASS in Pytorch
Implementation of GRASS with pytorch

This is an Pytorch implementation of our paper "GRASS: Generative Recursive Autoencoders for Shape Structures". The code was written by [Chenyang Zhu](http://www.sfu.ca/~cza68/) from Simon Fraser University and is being improved and maintained here in this repository.

Please refer the details to the [paper](http://kevinkaixu.net/projects/grass.html).
